# Deep Learning: Face recognition

## Open-Source Face Recognition Tools
- OpenFace
    - Brandon Amos and Carnegie Mellon University
- dlib
    - Davis King
- face_recognition
    - Simplified Python interface for the dlib face recognition API

## Face Recognition Pipeline Steps
- Step1: Locate and extract faces from each image
- Step2: Identify facial features in each image
- Step3: Align faces to match pose template
- Step4: Encode faces using a trained neural network
- Step5: Check Euclidean distance between face encodings
